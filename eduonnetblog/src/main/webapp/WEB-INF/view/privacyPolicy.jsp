            <p>Providing Products and Services. We use your personal information to provide you with the Services in order to perform our contract with you, including to process your payments, fulfill your orders, to send notifications to you related to your account, purchases, returns, exchanges, or other transactions, to create, maintain, and otherwise manage your account, to arrange for shipping, facilitate any returns and exchanges, and to enable you to post reviews.</p>
